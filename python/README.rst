    Library for working with labeled graphs in a variety of storage formats.

Motivation
----------

This project provides a set of primitives useful for building (visual)
domain-specific languages.

The essense of any programming language is represented by a graph
representing data dependencies, logical flow, operations, types, and more.
This is true even of visual programming languages. Nodes have many
connections of many different kinds to each other in a programming graph.

This project was inspired by a demonstration of
[progred](https://github.com/jbrownson/progred) at Strangeloop 2018 and
[View-Independent Program
Models](http://westoncb.blogspot.com/2015/06/how-to-make-view-independent-program.html).
